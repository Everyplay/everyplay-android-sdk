      If not linked into the project, the old login convention applies

    - The new improved Facebook login shares via Everyplay Facebook application,
      not through your existing Facebook application credentials. For immediate
      use, you might need to send your iOS bundle information or Android key
      hash to get started, please contact support@everyplay.com. We're currently
      working on making this step automated without extra work required on

      available from the Asset Store

    - Lots of internal plugin changes and file location changes for better Unity integration,
      the migration should be seamless without removing previous assets

    - New prefables integration. Instead of dragging a prefab to your first scene
      you may use the Edit / Everyplay Settings menu to enable Everyplay and to
      set your game credentials. This also allows you to temporarily disable
      Everyplay without removing the package

    - Double check that clientId, secret and redirectURI settings have merged into
      the new Edit / Everyplay Settings menu after upgrading

    - Calling Everyplay through the SharedInstance is now deprecated. You may still

      platform (iOS/Android)

    - iOS Everyplay.framework and bundle are now directly embedded into the package
      and used as the only option

    - First bunch of graphics optimization improvements, especially for Qualcomm
      and Mali GPUs. Depending on hardware used, up to 4x framerate improvement
      while recording

    - Generic activity handling improvements

### v1.0 - February 3rd 2014 (build 1000)

- Generic:
    - Initial public release with Unity support, others to follow

      For recording support, most devices running Android 4.1 (API level 16)
      or later should work

      For just browsing and using Everyplay social features, a device running
      Android 4.0 (API level 14) or later is required

      It's possible to target an application to run on older versions than 4.0,
      but all Everyplay SDK methods are non-functional

      Due to wide range of driver behaviour, hardware encoders, GPUs and
      Android version differences out there, Everyplay SDK caches device specific
      settings online from a remote server

      Until the settings are successfully received, the recording support is
      automatically disabled. After receiving the server response, the recording
      support is either enabled or continued to be disabled to workaround devices
      known to cause trouble. Next time the application is started, the settings
      are applied from the cache immediately upon startup without requiring network
      access

      It is also the fastest way to react when encountering unknown devices that
      could cause trouble, either by remotely disabling recording support or tuning
      device specific settings, in best case without requiring an SDK/application
      upgrade

- Unity plugin:
    - Unity 4.3 works out of the box with Build & Run

    - Unity 4.2 works as well, but you need to disable Version Control through
      Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor; to make up Android build improvements
      that have only been implemented in 4.3 release or later

    - Unity 4.1 and older releases work through some manual labor:

        - Disable Version Control through Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor or
          be prepared to manually remove all *.meta files from the exported project
          folder

        - Export an Eclipse project

        - Open the exported project. If there's a AndroidManifest.xml parse error,
          you may need to re-save it as UTF-8 (without BOM) in your favorite text
          editor

        - Append the following lines to project.properties:
```
          android.library.reference.1=Plugins/Android/everyplay
          manifestmerger.enabled=true
```

- Known issues:
    - Main focus is on testing the completeness of the SDK, multiple
      performance enhancements are currently in the works

    - Live FaceCam functionality is not yet implemented, Unity FaceCam
      functions currently return false or no-op on Android

    - No FaceCam commentary option in video editor yet
